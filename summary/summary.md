# Scrap your boilerplate

This will be a summary of scrap your boilerplate! Now, let's go and do it!

## Too much code?

Here we will throw the reader into and immediat example of boilerplate. Slim down the example from SYB such that it fits in a much shorter text. Don't go into how it works, just an example before and after.

## Who cares?

Writing the boilerplated code in the first place is tedious and a bit timeconsuming, but not really a big deal as long as it is a one-time gig. Here, describe the long-term consequences for maintenance:
- The code is fragile for data structure changes. 
  - Adding new code - salary in a new place will not be caught by the old code.
  - Modifying existing code - so much code may need to change.
- Much of the boilerplate has to be rewritten over and over again for new functionality

## The fix
Describe how it works in a short but complete way. This should cover what wasn't covered in the intro.

## What about polytypic programming
It's too strict.
- Describe why.
- Check if there's anything else we need to add

## Cool, now what?
Read the other papers that came after. What cool stuff happened there?

## Instructions
Your goal is to write a short article suitable for your fellow students, which will enable them to quickly learn about the topic. Write a summary of the paperâ€™s key ideas and relate them to the other papers you have read.
- What problem your main paper of choice is solving
- Why this problem is important
- The key ideas in the paper
- Why this paper is important (with reference to the papers that came before and after).
- Limited to 5 pages (not including references)
