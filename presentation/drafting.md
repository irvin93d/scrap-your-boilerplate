Define boiler plate:
In computer programming, boilerplate code—or simply, boilerplate—are sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation. When using languages that are considered verbose, the programmer must write a lot of code to accomplish only minor functionality. Such code is called boilerplate.
They actually cite the psrt Scrap you boilerplate, which is the paper I am presenting right now. Intestingly, the paper never gives a definition for what boilerplate is.

How many people in here code a lot of haskell?
 - if many: You're all probably thinking "Why is this guy showing us JS? Where are the monads? Is that function even pure?" I am a react developer, it pays the bills alright.
 - if few: Pheuw, I guess I can relax then. Was worried I'd had to defend why I am showing you this arbitrarily typed artifact for programming language. If anyone wonders, I am a react developer. It pays quiet well too.
 - if at Opera: I gave this talk to my my school where most people code haskell. For those who haven't written haskell before, it's an incredibly strictly typed purely functional language. Every one looked me strangely when I showed them Javascript and I had to explain that react development pays the bills. Here you guys are like "That JS is typed! Let's goooo!"
